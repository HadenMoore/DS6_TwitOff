# TwitOff
Reference code for DS Unit 3 Sprint 4 Guided Project, Cloud and Productization

Daily roadmap:
- Basic working app (static/hardcoded "Hello World" level), models, templates
- Connect to Twitter/Basilica APIs, augment models to save responses from APIs
- Forms/fancier templates/routes, logistic regression training/predicting
- Polish (add CSS), debug/discuss, deploy to Heroku

Stretch goals (some in this repo but *not* for live lecture):
- Really polishing (assigning HTML classes for CSS, anything JS)
- Caching (discuss on day 3 offline vs. online learning, but don't implement)
